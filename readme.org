* GPS convert
This shiny app is used to convert GPS coordinates for data that are
handled by CGI at NRM. Currently the code only supports RT90,
SWEREF99TM and WGS84. 

If you want to try this code you need to install the following packages.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  install.packages(c("shiny","DT","tidyverse",
                     "readxl","leaflet", "rgdal"))

#+END_SRC

After this you can launch the app with

#+BEGIN_SRC R
shiny::runGitHub("GPS-Convert", "CGI-NRM")

#+END_SRC

Note that this procedure requires an active internet connection at
launch.

You can also download the app and just open the app.R file in r-studio
and just press the "Run app" to start it. If prefer to run it outside
r-studio just copy the app.R code and paste it to your r-session to
launch the web app.

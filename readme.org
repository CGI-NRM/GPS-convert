* GPS convert
This shiny app is used to convert GPS coordinates for data that are
handled by CGI at NRM. Currently the code only supports RT90,
SWEREF99TM and WGS84. 

If you want to try this code you need to install the following packages.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  install.packages(c("shiny","DT","tidyverse",
                     "readxl","leaflet", "rgdal"))

#+END_SRC

After this you can launch the app with

#+BEGIN_SRC R
shiny::runGitHub("GPS-Convert", "CGI-NRM")

#+END_SRC

Note that this does require an active internet connection at launch.

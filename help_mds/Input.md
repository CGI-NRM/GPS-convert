## Input format
This tool will based on file endings do its best to import the file in
a useful format. Currently supported formats:

* _.ods_ - Open document spreadsheet (used by Libreoffice)
* _.xlsx, .xls_ - Microsoft excel file formats
* _.csv_ - comma separated file format
* _.txt, .tdf, .tsv_ - tab delimeted file format (probably the least
  stable as tabs are not always encoded in the same way)
